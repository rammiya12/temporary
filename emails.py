# Given a string representing a name, change it to follow the standard format
# for names.
# The standard format for names is:
#   - All words start with a capital letter
#   - There are no extra spaces at the beginning or the end
#
# >>> standardize_name("shevek")
# 'Shevek'
# >>> standardize_name("  ana MAria   ")
# 'Ana Maria'

# Given the names of the Santa (person giving the gift) and the Santee (person

# The email should:
#   - Use standardized names (we wrote a function for this!)
#   - Greet the Santa by their name
#   - Include the name of the Santee (so that the Santa knows who to give the
#     present to :))

# Optionally, the email may also include additional instructions, like:
#   - Tips for choosing a good gift
#   - The price range
#   - The day when the gifts will be given
